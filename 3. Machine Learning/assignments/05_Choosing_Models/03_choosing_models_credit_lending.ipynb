    "\n",
    "You work at a Bank in the credit risk department. Your stakeholders want to be able to determine the level of risk for all internal customers, so that if the customer applies for a new product (eg. loan, credit card, overdraft, mortgage) the correct decision can be made as to whether they should get the product or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the curent set up is that each individual product has their own way of determining a customer's level of risk. This means that a customer may be rejected to extend their overdraft to €2.000 but accepted to have a loan of €2.000 at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is providing a bad customer journey which is why the bank wants to consolidate this view of risk so that consistent lending decisions can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often customers who get rejected will complain about their decision so it is important that we can send advisers to them to talk through their situation and suggest a good option for their lending.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The regulators consider customers are \"unable to repay\" when they have missed 3 payments (on any product) in the last 2 years. \n",
